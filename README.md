# A concise representation for adaptive hexagonal meshes

This is the code accompanying the paper [A concise representation for adaptive hexagonal meshes](https://lhf.impa.br/ftp/papers/hex.pdf), submitted for publication (2024).

Adaptive hexagonal meshes were introduced in the paper [Hexagonal LOD for interactive terrain rendering](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228673405) by Sußner et al. (2005). See also [Hexagonal Delaunay triangulation](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-04319-2\_30) by Sußner and Greiner (2009) and [Hexagon-based all-quadrilateral mesh generation with guaranteed angle
  bounds](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2011.03.002) by Liang and Zhang (2011).

Running `make` outputs a sample adaptive hexagonal mesh in eps and csv. The eps file is converted to pdf using pstopdf. Choose the level of refinement by setting `R`, as in `make R=6`. Compute a sequence of increasingly refined meshes with `sh GRSI.sh`.

The file `in.csv` is a sample adaptive hexagonal mesh generated by random refinement. It can be loaded with `make I=in.csv`.

The code should work in both Python 2 and Python 3.
